## Automatic File Formatting

To ensure consistency and readability, the plugin can automatically format your source and translated files.

*   **Consistency:** Enforces consistent use of separators, indentation, and spacing.
*   **Configuration:** Respects your project's `.editorconfig` or IDE code style settings.
*   **User Control:** Prompts you before making any changes to your source files.

## Uncommitted Changes Detection

To provide the most accurate translations, the plugin can detect uncommitted changes in your version control system (Git).

*   **Context-Aware:** When you translate a file with uncommitted changes, the plugin will show you a diff of the changes and use the latest version of the file for translation.
*   **Accuracy:** This ensures that your translations are always based on the most up-to-date content.

## License Management

All plugins come with a 30-day free trial. You can manage your license directly within the IDE.

*   **Trial Period:** Enjoy full functionality for 30 days.
*   **License Activation:** Easily activate your purchased license in the plugin's settings.
*   **Notifications:** The plugin will notify you when your trial is about to expire or when your license needs renewal.
