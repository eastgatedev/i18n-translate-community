# i18n Translate Plugin Suite - Roadmap

## Vision: Complete Cross-Platform i18n Automation

Transform internationalization from a tedious manual process into an automated workflow across all major development platforms. Our plugin suite eliminates the complexity of managing translations, letting developers focus on building great products for global audiences.

### Revolutionary Mega Plugin Strategy

We're pioneering a **revolutionary mega plugin approach** with our Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) plugin - the first plugin to combine JVM, iOS, and Android capabilities in a single unified solution. This breakthrough eliminates the need for multiple separate plugins, providing seamless cross-platform i18n automation in one powerful package.

### Global Market Strategy

**Plugin Suite Internationalization**: The plugin suite itself will be fully internationalized to serve non-English developers worldwide, with priority focus on the China market and other major international developer communities.

## Current Release Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation Platforms (Released)
- **JVM Plugin** (Pro & Lite) - Properties file automation for Spring Boot, Java, Kotlin
- **Web Plugin** (Pro & Lite) - JSON file automation for React, Vue, Angular, Next.js

**ðŸŽ¯ Priority: Web Plugin Smart Text to i18n Completion**
Completing the Web plugin's Smart Text to i18n capabilities is a foundation priority, providing the full code transformation workflow that matches our JVM plugin's comprehensive functionality.

*Over 200 locales supported with intelligent batch processing and VCS integration*
