# Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for the i18n Translate plugin suite. Our goal is to provide the most powerful and user-friendly translation experience within the JetBrains ecosystem.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Seamless Integration:** Deeply integrate with the IDE for a native and intuitive workflow.

*   **Community-Driven:** Prioritize features and improvements based on user feedback and community input.

## Current Focus: Q3 2025

*   **Flutter Support:** Introduce a dedicated plugin for Flutter developers, supporting `.arb` file formats.
